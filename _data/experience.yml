  #summary: How to obtain a wide response area in photodetector has been a central issue since many carbon-based devices show photoresponse only in special contact area. We did investigation on amorphous carbon field-effect transistor and find the prominent photocurrent properties including large sensitive area and high current gain. 	<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Paper submitted</li><li>Another awesome project</li><li>or a team or department you worked with</li></ul>
