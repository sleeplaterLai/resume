  summary: The Cryogenic Underground Laboratory for Rare Events (CUORE) is an experiment located at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (Italy), which is designed to find neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ).<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Applied fitting on the CUORE data to do pulse shape discrimination.</li><li>Applied wavelet-based pulse shape discrimination method on the waveform.</li><li>Worked onsite (LNGS) as detector operations shifter (1) Worked underground to make sure the continuously data taking. (2) Monitored the cryogenic system constantly and responded the slow monitoring alarms. (3) Preliminary analysis of data quality, inserted bad flags for pulser failure.</li><li>Onsite analysis shifter (1) Run standard analysis and reported to the collaboration on analysis meeting. (2) Investigated the channels with bad calibration from the standard module for future recovery.</li></ul>

  #summary: How to obtain a wide response area in photodetector has been a central issue since many carbon-based devices show photoresponse only in special contact area. We did investigation on amorphous carbon field-effect transistor and find the prominent photocurrent properties including large sensitive area and high current gain. 	<ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Paper submitted</li><li>Another awesome project</li><li>or a team or department you worked with</li></ul>
  summary: <ul class="resume-item-list"><li>Fabricated carbon Nano-films based on silicon carbide and measured their photoresponse, where I observed position-sensitive and centimeter-range photodetection.</li><li>Proposed an analytical model to explain the position-sensitive and centimeter-range photodetection.</li><li>Simulated and assessed the quality of different structures using FDTD Solutions.</li></ul>
